Heidixe Fine Art
Hi, this is a website that features a gallery of a watercolor artist named Heidixe.

It by no means features the complete works, just a handful of selected images.

Heidixe Fine Art

Feel free to browse the site and check out the links to her fb, instagram and external website.

I created this site after completing a 12-week intensive front end web development course with General Assembly. It is the first website that I have ever created and uses a combination on HTML, CSS and Javascript. It is an ongoing project to which I will add more features over time. I hope you enjoy browsing the site as much as I enjoy creating it.

Thank you.
